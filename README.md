## Description
As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company, so that I can organize and plan my business. I built this project to test my knowledge and understanding of mySQL. Now I will be able to access and change information about the company using a simple command line application. During this project, I learned more about accessing a mySQL database via a command line application as well as how to connect the two.

## Installation
The application can be ran by cloning the github repo, installing dependencies, and changing the connection.js to match your mySQL login information.

Other requirements: Node

## Usage
After installation, the application can be ran by opening the integrated terminal and typing 'node index.js'. The database will then open and the user can follow the prompts.

Here is a video walkthrough of how the application works:
